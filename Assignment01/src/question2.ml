(* CS 414 â€“ Assignment 01, Q2: Binary trees, prune, and level traversal *)

(* --- Binary tree type (as in lecture) --- *)
type 'a tree =
  | Leaf
  | Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree

(* --- prune: remove all original leaves in one sweep ---
   If a node is a leaf (both children are Leaf), delete it (return Leaf).
   Otherwise, rebuild the node with pruned subtrees. *)
let rec prune = function
  | Leaf -> Leaf
  | Node (_, Leaf, Leaf) -> Leaf
  | Node (v, l, r) -> Node (v, prune l, prune r)

(* --- level_traversal: breadth-first (left-to-right) --- *)
let level_traversal (t : 'a tree) : 'a list =
  let rec bfs acc = function
    | [] -> List.rev acc
    | Leaf :: q -> bfs acc q
    | Node (v, l, r) :: q -> bfs (v :: acc) (q @ [l; r])
  in
  bfs [] [t]
