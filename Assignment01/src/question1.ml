(* Addition by Peano axioms:
   x + 0 = x
   x + S(y) = S(x + y) *)
let rec add x y =
  match x with
  | Z -> y
  | S x' -> S (add x' y)

  | Z, _ -> Z
  | S x', S y' -> sub_clamp x' y'

(* Comparison: x <= y *)

  | S _, Z -> false
  | S x', S y' -> leq x' y'

(* Strict comparison: x < y *)
let lt x y = leq (S x) y

(* Multiplication defined from addition:
   x * 0 = 0
   x * S(y) = x + (x * y)
   (equivalently, add y to itself x times) *)
let rec mul x y =
  match x with
  | Z -> Z
  | S x' -> add y (mul x' y)

(* Division with remainder by repeated subtraction.
   Requires divisor != 0.
   Returns (q, r) such that x = q*d + r and 0 <= r < d. *)
let div_rem x d =

(* Convenience wrappers to return just quotient or remainder *)
let div x d = fst (div_rem x d)
let rem x d = snd (div_rem x d)
